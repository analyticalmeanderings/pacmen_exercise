Project Title: PacMen Exercise
Description of Project: Have you ever wanted to see PacMen scramble across your screen? Look no further. This app leverages a PacMen factory to make copies. When you PacMen hit a wall, they turn around.
How to Run: Visit analyticalmeanderings.github.io/pacmen_exercise

Roadmap of future improvements: In future versions, the pacmen will eat each other. When a pacman eats another pacman, they grow in size. It will be a fight to the death.
License information: Incorporates the MIT license. Additional information can be found in the LICENSE file.
